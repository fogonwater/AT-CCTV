# Auckland Transport CCTV

Locations of Auckland Transport CCTV cameras based on the PDF document contained in the Aug 12 RNZ article [Auckland Transport's $4.5m plan could mean 8000 cameras watching the city](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/396465/auckland-transport-s-4-point-5m-plan-could-mean-8000-cameras-watching-the-city). The article links to a PDF table of camera locations.

I converted the table to CSV and Geojson format.

- CSV table has 2763 entries
- Geojson has 2299 entries (some cameras in source document do not have lat/lng coordinates)
